Tips for editing the Cycloids:
For those wishing to make changes to the reduction ratio, generally it is only necessary to change the cycloids located in the base, output shaft and the compound cycloid assembly. All cycloids should have the same eccentricity to function properly.The diameter of the cycloid is determined by the number of teeth: the diameter divided by the number of teeth should remain consistent for all cycloids in the reducer, and for the base and output shaft the diameter is the [(number of teeth * the constant) - eccentricity].
